Once upon a time, there was an foggy boy who heard sheep. He wanted some excitement so he pretended that there  
was a energetic breeze attacking his animals .  When the townspeople came, he reached at them. He had  
so much fun that he tried it again the following day and ran at the townspeople when they came to help.  The next day, a  
breeze really did come:verb his sheep and he vanished and whispered to call for help, but no one believed him  
and he lost his ghost .
